# VikingsAdventure (RPG Game)
## Idea
The idea of the game contained using all skills which I have got during courses. The game has **Quest** and **Dialogue Systems**, **Inventory**, **Stat System** and many other interesting things.

## About
(_Here I would like to tell about the plot a bit._)

Actions take place in **Xephalore** - great viking's country. People here was strong, but kind.

At one day citizen's lives were changed... The **Knights of Steel Swords** attacked them, so vikings were forced to retreat. 

All country was occupied by bad peoplle. One part of citizens were slained by knights and another part began to live in the forests... till up this day!

Great vikings built their own village and named it after their mother country - **Xephalore**.

You're **Ragnar**, a glorious viking who doesn't remember his past, but who wants to avenge his country. Citizens see your good intentions and will glad to help you.

***Slay all knights, find their king and find out about your past!***
